    description: >
      Is a bitcoin advertising network which does not collect any personal data.
      It has been around for a long time and is a very reputable service.
      To earn, publishers do not even need to register on the platform, they merely need
      to select an ad unit type, filter ads that can be displayed on their website,
      and set their withdrawal parameters. Publishers are paid per unique impressions,
      possibly on a daily basis, and can also earn through referred sales, depending on the advertisers.
